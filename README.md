# futilities

A collection of functional programming utilities.

## Goals

The goal of `futilities` is to provide a unified interface for working with common iterables, which include:

- native `Array`s and `Object`s
- Facebook's [Immutable](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js) `List`, `Map`, `Set`, and `Seq`
- generator functions
